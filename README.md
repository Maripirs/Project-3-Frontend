## Why a Whatsapp Clone? 
Project 3 presented the challenge to Reverse Engenieer a App with the objective of gaining better understanging of core Web Dev concepts.
WhatsApp seemed like a fun excercise to experiment with multiple clients interacting directly through the website.

<br><br>

## Whats next? 
I the future, the following features could be implemented<br>

- Create an Account Page, where the User Information will be displayed<br>
- Allow the User to change their profile image and display name<br>
- Make the messages and chats update in Real Time with the use of WebSockets<br>
- Allow the user to change the background of a specific chat<br>
- Giving the app a responsive design<br>
